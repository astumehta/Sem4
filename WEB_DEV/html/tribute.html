                Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.

                        Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, affectionately known as the Missile Man of India, left an indelible mark on the nation's history with his remarkable contributions in the fields of science, technology, and education. Before serving as India's President, he made significant strides as an aeronautical engineer with organizations like DRDO and ISRO. Renowned for his pivotal role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests and the development of missile and aerospace technologies, Kalam's legacy extends beyond his scientific achievements. He was a prolific author, poet, and scholar, with a deep-rooted commitment to inspiring and empowering the youth.
